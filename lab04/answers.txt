1. graphmenu.cpp was compiled because it was the only file that had a change.

2. graph.cpp was compiled this time the reason was because the change was made to its respective file.

3. This time it compiled both graphmenu.cpp and graph.cpp. Even though there was no changes in graphmenu.cpp I did however make a change in graph.h since graphmenu.o depend on graphmenu.cpp and graph.h it will compile it as well.

4. This time only graphmenu.cpp was compiled since the change was in the graphmenu.cpp file

5. It removes graph.o and graphmenu.o

6. It compiles graphmenu.cpp and graph.cpp, also recreates graphmenu.o graph.o
